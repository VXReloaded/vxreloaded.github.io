<p style="text-align:right; padding-left:30%;"><i>"You might not realise this, but hacking is bad [...] hacking is like breaking into somebody's house [...] it's okay to be into computers though."</i> <br/>â€”A couple of clinical psychologists (c. 2011)</p>

Following in the tradition of VX communities, both classical and contemporary, such as that of [VX Heaven](https://vxug.fakedoma.in/archive/VxHeaven/index.html), [VX Underground](https://vx-underground.org) and [MalDev](https://maldev101.github.io/), _VX Reloaded_ aims to contribute to the documentation, archiving, and potential revival, of the VX scene's golden age. This site contains some of the amateurish _virri_ by [Aleksey](https://github.com/Alekseyyy) and also aims to archive the works of other malware developers.

Some persons may say that malware is "bad." I will respond to that sentiment with the following question posed by [VX Heaven (n.d.)](https://vxug.fakedoma.in/archive/VxHeaven/index.html) when confronted with persons who voiced similiar concerns: _"is ignorance a defense?"_ I interpret this as a non-rhethorical question, and as an ex-philosophy undergrad, I invite anyone who thinks that malware is inherently "bad" to think about that.
